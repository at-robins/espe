<p>Calculates the overlap of differentially expressed genes between clusters.</p>
<p>
  <b>Output</b><br />
  For each clustering group a <code>overlapping_dge.csv</code> is produced containing the following columns:
<ul>
  <li><code>Gene</code>: the respective gene name</li>
  <li><code>Regulation</code>: the respective regulation of the gene (up or down)</li>
  <li><code>Overlap</code>: in how many clusters the gene showed the respective regulation</li>
  <li><code>Clusters</code>: a semi-colon separated list of the clusters the gene has been identified as differentially
    expressed with the respective regulation</li>
</ul>
