  This pipeline processes pre-processed single cell RNA-Seq data specifically
  from pre-sorted group 1 ILCs. It is meant for internal usage and very
  specific.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Input specifications</b>
  <br />
  Each sample needs to be provided as a separate folder containing a
  pre-processed <code>filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5ad</code> file. Additionally,
  the following comma delimeted and UTF-8 encoded CSV files are required at the
  experiment's root directory:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>sample_comparison.csv</code>: This file defines which samples are
    compared to each other. An example can be downloaded
    <a
      href="/api/pipelines/attachments/wiedemann_scrna_pipeline_ilcs/sample_comparison.csv"
      >here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>sample_clustering.csv</code>: This file defines which samples to pool
    for clustering. Each row represents all samples of a common clustering
    pool. An example can be downloaded
    <a
      href="/api/pipelines/attachments/wiedemann_scrna_pipeline_ilcs/sample_clustering.csv"
      >here</a
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  <b>System requirements</b><br />
  64 GB of RAM are recommended for pipeline execution.<br />
  Please also make sure you have sufficient storage space.
