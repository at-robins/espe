  This pipeline processes pre-processed single cell RNA-Seq data specifically
  from pre-sorted group 1 ILCs. It is meant for internal usage and very
  specific.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Input specifications</b>
  <br />
  Each sample needs to be provided as a separate folder containing a
  pre-processed <code>filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5ad</code> file. Additionally,
  a <code>sample_comparison.csv</code> (comma delimeted and UTF-8 encoded) at
  the directory root is needed that defines which samples are compared to each
  other. An example can be downloaded

    >here</a
  >.

<p>
  <b>System requirements</b><br />
  64 GB of RAM are recommended for pipeline execution.<br />
  Please also make sure you have sufficient storage space.
