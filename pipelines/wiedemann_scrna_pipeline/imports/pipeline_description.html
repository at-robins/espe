  This pipeline processes single cell RNA-Seq data. For data obtained with fixed
  cell protocols it is recommended to skip the ambient RNA removal step by using
  the according step variable below.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Input specifications</b>
  <br />
  Each sample needs to be provided as a separate folder containing the filtered
  and raw H5 count matrices that are output by
  <a href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/analysis/outputs/cr-outputs-overview">CellRanger</a>
  . The files need to end with <code>filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5</code> and
  <code>raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5</code> respectively.<br />
  Additionally, a <code>sample_information.csv</code> (comma delimeted and UTF-8 encoded) at the
  directory root is needed that is used for sample naming, replicate
  detection and batch correction. An example can be downloaded
  <a href="/api/pipelines/attachments/wiedemann_scrna_pipeline/sample_information.csv">here</a>.

<p>
  <b>System requirements</b><br />
  64 GB of RAM are recommended for pipeline execution.<br />
  Please also make sure you have sufficient storage space.
